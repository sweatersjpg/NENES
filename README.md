# NENES.js

NENES is a game engine that I'm developing using p5.js so that I can make little games more easily.

# How to use NENES

Now. Bare with me, I dont know how to make a real library (yet), but you can sort of use this like one.

To use it, you need to download NENES.js, and p5.js: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/releases/download/0.7.2/p5.min.js and include them as scripts in your html file.
```html
<html>
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <title>RGE</title>

      <style type="text/css">
      body {margin:0; padding:0;}
      canvas {display:block;}
      </style>

      <script src="p5.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
      <script src="NENES.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
      <script src="program.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </head>
</html>
```

Next you need to make a new .js and call it whatever you want, and also include it in your html file.
(in the example above the file is called "program.js")
