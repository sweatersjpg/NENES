## Under Maintenence

NENES (not exactly NES) is a game engine I created using p5.js, it's key features are: pixelated sprites (including pixelated rotation and scaling), palette swapping (different palettes can be assigned to sprites in real time), and pixelated text reminicent of the NES.

I created NENES so that I could quickly prototype my own games, and share them in a way that instantly loads up on a webpage.
For some exaples of games using NENES go to

This has been an ongoing project of mine for a few years as I learned to code, and that means a lot of the code is pretty terrible.
So I've decided to start from the ground up on a new engine called "Pixel Perfect p5.js Engine" or 3p5E.js for short.
